I’m a bit shy when I have to speak in English. I’m a little worried about making mistakes. I ____still lack confidence. Many of my friends don’t worried about mistakes. They just talk and talk. They always get the message across, even if the grammar is wrong. I think this is the best thing to do. My teacher always says it’s best to way to learn by doing . If I don’t try to speak English, I’ll never be able to use it when I need it. One thing I started doing recently was talking to myself . I have short conversations with myself. I think it works  . I also make short stories about people and say them aloud . I do this in my room, of course. People would think I`m crazy if I did it in class or on the train.
